</p>

A powerful application to manage your time. We are aiming to create the simplest yet most detailed app, where all you need to do is use it to manage your time for all your activities in life. You can use this app as a to-do list, calendar, habit tracker, pomodoro timer for focus mode, and you can review statistics that reflect your efforts at any given time. 

This app is continuously being developed and refined. In the future, the app will be available on multiple platforms such as iOS, MacOS, Windows, Linux... and you will be able to sync data across all platforms.

### Support us
If you really like this app, please rate it on the stores and share it with your friends. 

Currently, the app does not contain ads and we really do not want to embed ads in this app. However, we still need finances to maintain and continue developing the app. We would be very grateful if you could support the app development team... for example, by buying us a cup of coffee...
